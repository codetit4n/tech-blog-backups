## Statements and Expressions

We learned about functions in the [last blog](https://codetitan.hashnode.dev/rust-series-4#heading-functions-in-rust) of this series. Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression.

### But, why do we need to learn about statements and expressions?

Because Rust is an *expression-based language*. This means Rust is a programming language in which every (or nearly every) construction is an expression and thus yields a value.

### How are statements and expressions different from each other?

* **Statements** are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
    
* **Expressions** evaluate to a resultant value.
    

Examples:

We’ve already used statements and expressions. Creating a variable and assigning a value to it with the `let` keyword is a statement. Example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 6;
}
```

In the above example, the `let` statement is not the only statement, the `main` function is also a statement(since it doesn't return a value).

NOTE: Function definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a statement in itself.

Statements do not return values. Therefore, you can’t assign a `let` statement to another variable, as the following code tries to do; you’ll get an error:

```rust
let x = (let y = 6);
```

This is because the `let y = 6` statement does not return a value, so there isn’t anything for `x` to bind to.

**Important side note**:

This is different from what happens in other languages, such as C and Ruby, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In those languages, you can write `x = y = 6` and have both `x` and `y` have the value `6`; that is not the case in Rust.

Expressions evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code that you’ll write in Rust. Consider a math operation, such as `5 + 6`, which is an expression that evaluates to the value `11`.

### Expressions can be part of statements

The `6` in the statement `let x = 6;` is an expression that evaluates to the value `6`. Calling a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression. A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression.

Important Example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let k = {
        let w = 3;
        w + 1
    };

    println!("The value of k is: {k}");
}
```

In this example, the expression:

```rust
{
    let w = 3;
    w + 1
}
```

is a block that, evaluates to `4`. That value gets bound to `k` as part of the `let` statement. Note that the `w + 1` line doesn’t have a semicolon at the end. Remember, we were not allowed to put a semicolon at the end of a function in the [last lesson](https://codetitan.hashnode.dev/rust-series-4#heading-returning-data-from-a-function).

**The thing is**:

Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value. Keep this in mind.

NOTE: In the [last blog](https://codetitan.hashnode.dev/rust-series-4#heading-returning-data-from-a-function) when we tried to return a value from the function using an explicit `return` statement and put a semicolon after that, it worked. This was because due to the `return` present there, the function returned/terminated at that point.

Now, let's explore the above example to further understand this concept. So, consider this part of the example:

```rust
let k = {
    let w = 3;
    w + 1
};
```

You can see there is a semicolon at the end after `}` . This is because of the let statement. Being a statement it should not return any value so, if I remove this semicolon it will throw an error. A semicolon tells Rust this is where this statement ends.

NOTE: Go to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/codetit4n/rust-school), clone it, and try out different things like adding, and removing semicolons and experiment to make sure you really understand this part as it is very important.

## Control Flow

In Rust, the code is executed line-by-line. But this can be changed using certain expressions (Note, the word expression is used here).

The most common constructs that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are `if` expressions and loops.

### `if` Expressions

An `if` expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions. You provide a condition and then state, “If this condition is met, run this block of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code.”

Example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition true");
    } else {
        println!("condition false");
    }
}
```

Here, after the `if` we have a condition which, if `true` it will go inside the first block (`{}`) and if it is `false` it will go inside the other block. So, here since `3` is less than `5` it will print `condition true`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676496278283/c675484d-7fd5-42c2-bafe-a953bec9f449.png align="left")

Side Note: The if statements are called *branches* and the blocks of code associated with the conditions in `if` expressions are sometimes called *arms.*

One more this to note is that the `else` part is optional.

It’s also worth noting that the condition in this code *must* be a `bool`. If the condition isn’t a `bool`, we’ll get an error. For, example the following code will throw an error:

```rust
let number = 3;

if number {
    println!("number was three");
}
```

It will give:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676496709037/ee695b6d-3ed5-44a0-8b8e-ce6de4a11944.png align="center")

Here, you can see the amazing Rust compiler explains the problem very well.

### Handling multiple conditions with `else if`

Similar to other programming languages you can also use the `else if` expression like this:

```rust
let another_number = 6;

if another_number % 4 == 0 {
    println!("number is divisible by 4");
} else if another_number % 3 == 0 {
    println!("number is divisible by 3");
} else if another_number % 2 == 0 {
    println!("number is divisible by 2");
} else {
    println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
}
```

Here, according to the value of `another_number` the program has 4 paths:

* Is `another_number` divisible by 4
    
* Is `another_number` divisible by 3
    
* Is `another_number` divisible by 2
    
* if it satisfies any of the above cases it will give output accordingly otherwise it will execute the `else`
    

In our example the output will be:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676497320769/eafd744c-a7a4-40ec-ad56-486eddee776b.png align="left")

Note that even though 6 is divisible by 2, we don’t see the output `number is divisible by 2`, nor do we see the `number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2` text from the `else` block. That’s because Rust only executes the block for the first `true` condition, and once it finds one, it doesn’t even check the rest.

### Nested `if else`

```rust
let a = 201;

if a > 99 {
    if a > 200 {
        println!("Huge number");
    } else {
        println!("Big number");
    }
} else {
    println!("Small number");
}
```

Here, if `a` is greater than `99` then it will go inside the first branch and if it is not it will go to the outer `else` . Now, if it goes inside the first branch then it will check again if `a` is greater than `200` it will execute the inner `if` otherwise, it will execute the inner `else`. Output:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676498047969/317e7e2f-27f5-4e30-b41d-47ce835e5174.png align="left")

Side Note: One suggestion try to always include "else" unless there truly is no alternative case.

### Using `if` in a `let` statement

Because `if` is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a `let` statement to assign the outcome to a variable. It will look like this:

```rust
let condition = true;
let the_number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

println!("The value of the_number is: {the_number}");
```

Here, The `the_number` variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of the `if` expression. Output:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676498861736/141cf2bc-f1b2-4870-b443-5721c0e5694e.png align="left")

Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and numbers by themselves are also expressions.

Now, if I try to do this:

```rust
let condition = true;
let new_number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };
```

It will throw an error. The expression in the `if` block evaluates to an integer and the expression in the `else` block evaluates to a string. This won’t work because variables must have a single type, and Rust needs to know at compile time what type the `new_number` variable is, definitively.

Side Note: Knowing the type of `new_number` lets the compiler verify the type is valid everywhere we use `new_number`. Rust wouldn’t be able to do that if the type of `new_number` was only determined at runtime; the compiler would be more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code if it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for any variable.

## Repetition

This is another way of controlling the flow of code execution in Rust. It’s often useful to execute a block of code more than once. This is done by using various types of loops, which will run through the code inside the loop body to the end and then start immediately back at the beginning. This is also sometimes called *looping*.

### Repeating code with `loop`

The loop keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly stop it.

**But, wait why would you want to run some code forever?**

Let me give you an example of this situation. Let's say you have an embedded device that is monitoring the temperature of a device and we want it to alert us if the temperature goes above some value, then this forever loop can come in handy.

Example:

```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```

If I try to run this, I will get a non-terminating program that is printing "again!" constantly in my terminal. To terminate this you can press `ctrl-c` on your keyboard.

Note: Do forget to terminate this program.

**Breaking from a**`loop`

Rust also provides ways to break from a loop using the `break` keyword:

```rust
let mut counter = 0;
loop {
    counter += 1;

    if counter == 10 {
        break;
    }
}
println!("The value of counter is {counter}");
```

In this example, we have a mutable variable `counter` which keeps on increasing by `1` until it reaches `10` and then breaks/exits from the loop because of the `break` keyword. Output:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676550883074/fa56f0ac-55b9-4a9a-95b6-25c335a730cd.png align="left")

`coninue`**keyword**

Rust provides a special keyword `continue` which when encountered, that particular iteration is terminated, and the control is returned to the loop head, typically continuing with the next iteration. For example:

```rust
let mut number = 0;
loop {
    number = number + 1;
    if number == 10{
        break;
    }
    if number % 2 == 0 {
        continue;
    }
    println!("{number}");
}
```

Let's understand the `continue` keyword with the above example:

Here, we have a mutable variable `number` with an initial value of `0`. When we come inside the loop first the `number` is incremented by `1` , then we check if the `number` is equal to `10`, if it is, we break out of the `loop` using the `break` statement. If it is not we move on to the next condition which is: is the `number` divisible by `2`(even number), if yes then we execute the `continue` , which would mean that this particular iteration will be stopped and anything below this will not execute.

So, here if I get an even number I will continue with the loop but skip this iteration. i.e., the `println!("{number}");` (below this `if`) will not execute. And if the number is not even it will simply print that number. So, this should print all the odd numbers between `1` and `10`. Output:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676554868695/0986c161-7e4e-4b63-ab45-de0495e26de5.png align="left")

### Returning values from Loops

One of the uses of a `loop` is to retry an operation you know might fail, such as checking whether a thread has completed its job. You might also need to pass the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code.

To do this you can add the value you want to be returned after the `break` expression you use to stop the loop; that value will be returned out of the loop so you can use it.

Example:

```rust
let mut new_counter = 0;

let result = loop {
    new_counter += 1;

    if new_counter == 10 {
            break new_counter * 2;
    }
};

println!("The result is {result}");
```

Note this part: `break new_counter * 2;` . Here, we are returning the `new_counter * 2` from the loop by putting it after the `break` . Output:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676556079080/882fd525-114f-4ad8-84d6-e0795c19675c.png align="left")

### Loop labels

If you have loops within loops, `break` and `continue` apply to the innermost loop at that point. You can optionally specify a *loop label* on a loop that you can then use with `break` or `continue` to specify that those keywords apply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop.

Loop labels must begin with a single quote. It looks like this:

```rust
'labeled: loop{
}
```

Here is an example of this in practice:

```rust
let mut count = 0;
'counting_up: loop {
    println!("count = {count}");
    let mut remaining = 10;

    loop {
        println!("remaining = {remaining}");
        if remaining == 9 {
            break;
        }
        if count == 2 {
            break 'counting_up;
        }
        remaining -= 1;
    }

    count += 1;
}
println!("End count = {count}");
```

The outer loop has the label `'counting_up`, and it will count up from 0 to 2. The inner loop without a label counts down from 10 to 9. The first `break` that doesn’t specify a label will exit the inner loop only. The `break 'counting_up;` statement will exit the outer loop. Output:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676563356094/b33082dc-30d6-402b-9d8e-60ce0bb26731.png align="left")

### Conditional Loops with `while`

The infinite loops with an optional termination condition are not always practical. Enter `while` loops. A while loop looks like:

```rust
while condition {

}
```

This loop will run until the `condition` is `true`. This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used `loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`, and it’s clearer. While a condition evaluates to `true`, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop.

Example:

```rust
let mut val = 3;

while val != 0 {
    println!("{val}");

    val -= 1;
}
```

In this example until the value of `val` is not equal to `0`, the loop will run. And the `val` will keep decreasing by `1` on every iteration. Output:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676563979037/3c6bea5e-450f-4714-9717-977a44f62cf3.png align="left")

### Looping through a collection with `for`

Iterating through a collection(like an array) can be done easily using the `for` loop. We can also use `while` loop for this, but `for` loop is a more concise alternative. Example:

```rust
let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

for element in a {
    println!("the value is: {element}");
}
```

In this example, we are iterating through the array `a` using the `for` loop. Output:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676567423062/b72cace9-bcb5-4bc3-be67-73cb7239a8f8.png align="left")

This can also be done using a `while` loop:

```rust
let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
let mut index = 0;

while index < 5 {
    println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

    index += 1;
}
```

It will also give the same output. But you can see how much easier `for` loop makes this.
